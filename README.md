# Complex Data Structures and Algorithm Implementation Project

## Introduction
This project is designed to deepen understanding and skills in implementing advanced data structures and algorithms through practical programming tasks. The project focuses on various algorithm implementations including Horspool, Brute Force, Prim's, Kruskal's, and Dijkstra's algorithms in Java, providing a comprehensive approach to solving complex problems in computer science.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm Comparisons**: Implements and compares the efficiency of the Horspool and Brute Force algorithms in pattern matching.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Utilizes Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms to find minimum spanning trees in graphs, demonstrating the use of different data structures like min-heaps and union-find.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Employs Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in weighted graphs, highlighting the use of priority queues.
- **Complex Data Structures**: In-depth usage of Hash Set, Hash Table, Min-Heap, and Priority Queues to manage and process data efficiently.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly console menu to interact with the program, allowing dynamic input and display of algorithm outputs.

## Technical Requirements

- **Java Development Environment**: Code is written and tested in Java, requiring a Java compiler and runtime environment to execute.
- **Data Structure Implementation**: Detailed implementation of complex data structures to support algorithm efficiency and performance.
- **Performance Measurement**: Includes timing mechanisms to measure and compare the performance of different algorithms.
